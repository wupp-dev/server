# Should ViaVersion check for updates?

# Easier to configure alternative to 'block-protocols'. Uses readable version strings with possible '<' and '>' prefixes.
# An example to block 1.16.4, everything below 1.16, as well as everything above 1.17.1 would be: ["<1.16", "1.16.4", ">1.17.1"]
# You can use both this and the block-protocols option at the same time as well.
block-versions: []
# Block specific Minecraft protocol version numbers.
# List of all Minecraft protocol versions: http://wiki.vg/Protocol_version_numbers, or use a generator: https://via.krusic22.com

# Change the blocked disconnect message
block-disconnect-msg: You are using an unsupported Minecraft version!
# If you use ProtocolLib, we can't reload without kicking the players.
# (We don't suggest using reload either, use a plugin manager)
# You can customise the message we kick people with if you use ProtocolLib here.
reload-disconnect-msg: Server reload, please rejoin!
# We warn when there's a error converting item and block data over versions, should we suppress these? (Only suggested if spamming)

# BungeeCord allows you to have different server versions inside.
# Instead of you entering all the versions of these servers, we can ping them.
# 
# What interval would you like us to ping at? (in seconds)
# Use -1 to disable.
bungee-ping-interval: 60
# If the above is enabled, should we save the info to the config (in the section below)
bungee-ping-save: true
# To get a servers protocol, ViaVersion will do the following:
# Look for the server in the following section, then look for the last ping if bungee-ping is enabled
# otherwise use default.
# 
# The format for the following is:
#  servername: protocolversion
# You can find protocol ids on http://wiki.vg/Protocol_version_numbers
# It will fallback to the default option if none found.

  default: 47

# ----------------------------------------------------------#
# THIS FEATURE IS DISABLED ON 1.17.1+ PAPER SERVERS, SINCE IT HAS A BETTER PACKET-LIMITER INBUILT
# 
# Packets Per Second (PPS) limiter (Use -1 on max-pps and tracking-period to disable)
# Clients by default send around 20-90 packets per second.
# 
# What is the maximum per second a client can send (Use %pps to display their pps)
# Use -1 to disable.
max-pps: 800
max-pps-kick-msg: You are sending too many packets!
# 
# We can also kick them if over a period they send over a threshold a certain amount of times.
# 
# Period to track (in seconds)
# Use -1 to disable.
tracking-period: 6
# How many packets per second counts as a warning
tracking-warning-pps: 120
# How many warnings over the interval can we have
# This can never be higher than "tracking-period"
tracking-max-warnings: 4
