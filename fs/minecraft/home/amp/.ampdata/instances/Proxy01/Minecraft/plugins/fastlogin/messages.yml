# In order to split a message into separate lines you could just make a new line, but keep the '
# Example:

# Second line
# Third line'

# If you want to disable a message, you can just set it to an empty value.
# In this case no message will be sent

# The user skipped the authentication, because it was a premium player
auto-login: '&2Auto logged in'

# FastLogin attempted to auto register user. The user account is registered to protect it from cracked players
# If FastLogin is respecting auth plugin IP limit - the registration may have failed, however the message is still displayed
# The password can be used if the mojang servers are down, and you still want your premium users to login (PLANNED)

# authentication. In this state the client expects a success packet with an encrypted connection or disconnect packet.
# So we kick the player, if we cannot encrypt the connection. In other situation (example: premium name check),
# the player will be just authenticated as cracked

# The server sends a verify-token within the premium authentication request. If this doesn't match on response,
# it could be another client sending malicious packets

# The client sent no request join server request to the mojang servers which would proof that it's owner of that
# account. Only modified clients would do this.
